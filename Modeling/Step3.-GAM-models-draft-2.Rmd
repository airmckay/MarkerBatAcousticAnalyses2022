### Notes from meeting with Katrine 29.11.2022

1. For the total bat data set, with y = binary nightly bat activity 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
a. Adjust the k value for the bats_tot model to find one that better suits the data
b. Illustrate the wind/temperature cutoffs. 
- At some point, it may be necessary to re-aggregate the weather data to Facility rather than across both facilities
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```{r, results = FALSE}

# set project working directory according to the user system info 
# Otherwise, all the data (inputs and outputs, including figures) can be stored on a shared OneDrive folder

user <- Sys.info()['effective_user'] 
user
# this should print your nmbu user name - "apmc" in my case. 

wd <- getwd()
wd
# "C:/Users/apmc/OneDrive - Norwegian University of Life Sciences/Documents/1. PhD_Main/GitHub_link/MarkerBatAcousticAnalyses/MarkerBatAcousticAnalyses2022"



### Here is some example code from Pierre that I would like to implement soon which allows us to adjust all the directories based on the user

# if(Sys.info()['user'] == 'pidu') {                                                                                                                                               ## Pierre

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The "bats_tot" dataset 
Nightly aggregated total bat activity 

# Preparing the dataset for modeling 
Starting with bats total 
```{r, echo = FALSE}
str(bats_tot) #Seems like our factor variables are back to 'chr' variables again....
names(bats_tot)
#Housekeeping to make character variables factors
bats_tot$Habitat <- factor(bats_tot$Habitat)
bats_tot$Locality <- factor(bats_tot$Locality)
bats_tot$Site <- factor(bats_tot$Site)
bats_tot$Facility <- factor(bats_tot$Facility) 
bats_tot$jnight <- yday(bats_tot$night)

#Explore relationships and look check for outliers again
par(mfrow = c(3,2))
plot(bats_tot$jnight, bats_tot$batpass_prop)            
plot(bats_tot$temp_mean, bats_tot$batpass_prop)
plot(bats_tot$temp_max, bats_tot$batpass_prop)
plot(bats_tot$wind_mean, bats_tot$batpass_prop)
plot(bats_tot$wind_max, bats_tot$batpass_prop)

#The batspass_prop variable is "number of hours with >0 batpass" / "total number of observation hours" - per night
#This is your response, but often proportion variables cannot be modelled directly 
```
 
### Steps to prepare binary response (1=batpass, 0 = no batpass)
```{r}
# This is now only nightly aggregated so I am not sure this has the same intended effect... 

bats_tot$yes_batpass <- bats_tot$batpass01_sum   #batpass01_sum is sum of '1' values in batpass01, i.e. number of observ. hours per night when batpass recorded
bats_tot$no_batpass <- bats_tot$batpass01_length - bats_tot$batpass01_sum #batpass01_length is number of observ. hours per night

summary(bats_tot)

```

Fitting he full model (I recommend not making the model more complex than this)
Will have to do trial-and-error to get the k right

```{r}
m1 <- gam(cbind(yes_batpass,no_batpass) ~
              s(Locality, bs = "re") +                       #bs = "re" is equivalent to adding Locality as random intercept in a mixed model (GAMM)
              s(jnight, by = Habitat, bs = "gp", k =90) +    #allows for separate shapes of relationships with jnight for each habitat, bs = "gp" takes care of temporal autocorrelation
              Habitat +                                      #main effect of habitat (testing if means differ between habitats)
              s(temp_mean) +                                 #does not seem to make much difference whether I use max or mean temp, so I chose mean (feels less like cherry-picking, I think...)
              s(wind_mean) +                                 #same as for temp
              ti(temp_mean,wind_mean) ,                      #interaction between temp and wind
              data = bats_tot, method = "REML",                  #REML is not default, but is highly recommended by experts
              family = binomial, select=TRUE)                #may have to shift to quasibinomial if overdispersion, select = TRUE gives you automatic model selection

summary(m1) # not *quite* all terms significant - not Locality or jnight*Habitat 
# output below 
```

### Katrine: 
The reason why I use GAM with a rather simple random effect instead of GAMM, is that there are fewer options (e.g., distributions) available in GAMM

Model validation (may also use dHARMA to get more fancy validation plots)
Note that validation if binomial models is usually a pain and does not give meaningful validation plots
However, it works in our case, because of the aggregated nature of the data :-)
I found a similar example in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgw4cu8hrZM&t=4038s 


```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
gam.check(m1)           #look at the plots, but also the output to check if k needs to be adjusted
gam.check(m1, rep=500)  #rep=500 gives you a polygon on the QQ plot, which the observed values should lie within

overdispersion.m1 <- sum( residuals(m1, "pearson")^2 ) / m1$df.residual
overdispersion.m1
# 0.80653 - looking good! 

## Not overdispersed but the k values are off. 

# From Katrine's Step3B GAM modelling script: 
#[1] 1.022701    #this value should ideally be 0.8-1.2, but it's not very bad!

```

### Basis dimension (k) checking results: 
The k-index should be approx. 1 or larger
Play play around with k....

```{r}
bmp(file.path(output_today, "checking k dimensions m1 bats_tot.jpg"), width = 9, height = 6, units = "in", res = 350)

plot(m1, pages=1,scheme=2,shade=TRUE,seWithMean = TRUE)

draw(m1, scales ="free")         #function 'draw' is from package 'gratia'
draw(m1, scales ="fixed")

dev.off() 

## Visualize the 3D GAM
bmp(file.path(output_today, "3D gam m1 bats_tot.jpg"), width = 9, height = 6, units = "in", res = 350)
par(mfrow = c(1,2))

vis.gam(m1, view = c("temp_mean", "wind_mean"))    #Not a very elegant plot, you can find prettier solutions, but helps understand the interaction between temp and wind
vis.gam(m1, view = c("wind_mean", "temp_mean")) 

dev.off()

vis.gam(m1, view = c("temp_mean", "wind_mean"))    
vis.gam(m1, view = c("wind_mean", "temp_mean")) 




```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# m2 
### model temperature as linear effect

```{r}
m2 <- gam(cbind(yes_batpass,no_batpass) ~
            s(Locality, bs = "re") +                      
            s(jnight, by = Habitat, bs = "gp", k =90) +    
            Habitat +                                      
            temp_mean +                                 
            s(wind_mean) +                                 
            ti(temp_mean,wind_mean) ,                      
          data = bats_tot, method = "REML",                  
          family = binomial, select=TRUE)              
summary(m2) 

```

Only ti(temp_mean, wind_mean) is significant...

### Basis dimension (k) checking results: 
```{r}

par(mfrow = c(2,2))
gam.check(m2)
gam.check(m2, rep=500)  

### Interpreting gam.check() output
## First check if the model converges - this does after 18 iterations!
## If it didn't then the results would not be meaningful 
## Now each smooth term is evaluated to see if the residuals of these terms are randomly distributed. 
## If the p value is low for a smooth term, then the residuals are not random and most likely the K value should be increased. 
## In this case, the p value of tensor product interaction term (ti) for  temp and mean is very low and the current k value is 16. Notice that the other k values on the smooth terms are either 9 or close to 90. 
## Tensor product smooths and interaction, playing with k for these types of terms in not the same as for normal smooth terms... need to specify both the k-values i.e. k = c(4,5) 

## quick rundown on some of the lexicon behind tensor terms: 
#   te() is like x*Z or x + z + x:z if you want to write it all out
#   ti() is like X:Z only
## 

overdispersion.m2 <- sum( residuals(m2, "pearson")^2 ) / m2$df.residual
overdispersion.m2 
# Now at [1] 0.7804294, a bit under dispersed. 


```

### Basis dimension (k) checking results: 

```{r}

bmp(file.path(output_today, "checking k dimensions m2 bats_tot.jpg"), width = 9, height = 6, units = "in", res = 350)

plot(m2, pages=1,scheme=2,shade=TRUE,seWithMean = TRUE)

draw(m2, scales ="free")         #function 'draw' is from package 'gratia'
draw(m2, scales ="fixed")

dev.off() 

## Visualize the 3D GAM
bmp(file.path(output_today, "3D gam m2 bats_tot.jpg"), width = 9, height = 6, units = "in", res = 350)
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
vis.gam(m2, view = c("temp_mean", "wind_mean"))    
vis.gam(m2, view = c("wind_mean", "temp_mean")) 
dev.off()

vis.gam(m2, view = c("temp_mean", "wind_mean"))    
vis.gam(m2, view = c("wind_mean", "temp_mean")) 




```

## Recap

This model is more under dispersed than the last one and the issue of an ill-fitting k value is still there.

summary(m1) # R-sq.(adj) =  0.365   Deviance explained = 37.4%
summary(m2) # R-sq.(adj) =  0.369   Deviance explained = 37.5%

However, this doesn't seems to make a huge difference in the overall fit of the model to the data 

Changing the the mean temperature term to a linear variable doesn't appear to make a huge difference on the model fit, if anything it is a slightly poorer fit of the data. So I will keep this as a smooth term and adjust k values on the ti(temp_mean, wind_mean term instead)


Some notes from Katrine: 

<!-- See "Step 3B GAM modelling.R" script for examples of pruning the data to make it a bit easier to work with. 

<!-- #But it is really a hassel to have to predict for levels of Locality... -->
<!-- #One trick is to swap Loaclity with Facility in the mp model and refit the model -->
<!-- #Then you get away with predicting for Facility South (or North) -->
<!-- #But there is a way of excluding terms when predicting, see: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidymv/vignettes/predict-gam.html -->
<!-- #But I have not had time to figure this out yet. -->

## Recap

Ultimately the goal for this model group is to determine how weather patterns influence bat activity across the park. 
Therefore, it is better to include the met tower data. So pruning the dataset in this way is not helpful.

I could adjust high winds or temperatures to a certain cutoff to reduce some variability there but I am not ready to do that just yet. Instead, I am better there is a way to adjust the k values systematically across the smooth terms. I will go back to using temperature as a linear term, as it basically behaves this way naturally. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This did not help, it seems like ti(temp_mean,wind_mean) is the main issue regardless of what I do. 

I am going to switch to using a negative binomial model. 


# Troubelshooting under dispersed binomial gams with random effects 
Making a higher k value can help with improving the model fit but it tends to lead to underdispersion in this case. Removing the met tower data makes the models easier to work with. 

To Address under dispersion in binary GAMs:

https://dergipark.org.tr/en/download/article-file/922496 
This article suggests using an extended Altham distribution (EAD) family for under dispersed binomial count data- 
however I cannot find any commands in the mgcv package that will allow me to call that distribution.

The MM package does have the option to use this family but before changing packages, it is perhaps wiser to try and use counts as a response variable
